=================

ePrints theme based on University of Leeds branding

This theme contains static files (CSS, Javascript, XML page templates) to determine the look and feel of an eprints repository. All files are loaded in addition to the core eprints files, and much of the look and feel of the repository pages is governed by them - the main changes are in the page layout, with some changes in typography and other formatting.

The CSS and JS for the theme are maintained by a separate project - [University of Leeds Design System](https://designsystem.leeds.ac.uk/).
